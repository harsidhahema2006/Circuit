# How to Run in VS Code

Since this is a Python (Flask) app, "Live Server" won't work. You need to run the Python server.

1.  **Open the Terminal** in VS Code:
    *   Click `Terminal` in the top menu bar.
    *   Select `New Terminal`.

2.  **Run the App**:
    *   Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```

3.  **Open the App**:
    *   You will see a message like `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
    *   Hold `Ctrl` and click that link, or open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
